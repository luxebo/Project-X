Mechcommander Online/3
-F2P for multiplayer and one campaign
-Pay for other campaigns/story
-Two modes, one with simpler gameplay and just right click rts style
-Other is mechanic based, land skillshots and heat management and jump management etc
-Some mechs sold? Maybe p2w issue, maybe just cosmetics + campaign modes
-Modeling/graphics are a huge issue
-Copywrite issues as well are an issue

World War 2 Tabletop/Turn based
-Turn based World War 2 campaign mode
-Similar to Megamek or Battletech
-Graphics heavy but easier to code (turn based similar to 3d card game)
-Wouldn't appeal if not done well? If done well would have a really good niche though
-Macro campaign portion building units/army and then an actual battle simulator style portion
-Endless campaign (story is limited to some portion but afterwards depending on what faction can add to history possibly)

2D Path of Exile Style platformer
-Easiest to make
-Similar design to what we have already (Jerrell's smaller platformer)
-RPG elements and some sort of storyline that appeals
-Characters can do all sorts of things and have certain elements to them (sorta like warframe or path of exile with each with different mechanics to do things)
